This version introduces a new advanced "focus mode" that blends seamlessly with the highlight feature, a new `distraction free` user interface, new styles and many more improvements.    

# Focus Mode 

Three focus modes are available: 

- Sentence 
- Paragraph 
- Bloc

See the Nodio Help under `Help` -> `Nodio Help` in section `3. Focus`  for more information.  

# UI Redesign 

This release also contains a redesign of the UI. Among introduced changes, we removed the sidebars as they prove to be more distracting than initially thought. The `Navigator Tool selector button` allows to change the tool which can be used. Nodio currently has 3 tools available: 

- navigator 
- tags 
- audio 

Also, a new `File Info Popover` in the editor title bar allows quick access to different general file information (name, path) and file statistics.


# New styles 

Working on `Focus Mode` gave us the opportunity the revisit the available styles in Nodio, and we made great improvements there also! We added a new `Solarized` style based on [Ethan Schoonover
](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) canonical formalisation. In fact, all styles have been completely redesigned.  

# Distraction Free 

The removal of the sidebars also allowed us to implement a true `distraction free` mode which we think is important for a text editor to have as most writers want to write in a frictionless environment as possible. Creators at work should not be distracted by the tool they use..  


# And many more... 

Many other improvements has been introduced, some of them more hidden and will become more `visible` in the upcoming version.  

Nodio is still free! Again, this release, as the previous ones, is mostly aimed at getting as much feedbacks as possible. Tell us what you think at support@textually.net. What features are the most important for you? Anything you would like to be prioritized? Did you encounter any issue while using the App? Anything. Really.  

Thank you and enjoy!

This version is aimed at fixing to minor issues with the release 0.9.0. 

Nodio is still free! Again, this release, as the previous ones, is mostly aimed at getting as much feedbacks as possible. Tell us what you think at support@textually.net. What features are the most important for you? Anything you would like to be prioritized? Did you encounter any issue while using the App? Anything. Really.

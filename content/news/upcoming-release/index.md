Dear all! 
 
 We have not forgot you. We have been working hard the last months on 
 some fundamental improvements to Stylo which will be released soon. In the meantime, 
 a new text editor sharing the same framework as Stylo will come shortly. This new 
  text editor will bring, among others, files outline and audio recording support. 
  
 Stay tuned for the annoncements! 
 
 In the meantime, we wish you all happy holidays!

Stylo is now highlightable!!! Newly introduced in version 0.4.0, the possibility to highlight your texts using simple tags. 

Simply assign relevant tags/attributes to parts of your texts as you write and later reveal/highlight them to better find the information you need. It could be useful to reveal parts of your texts that talk about a character, a subject or even find personal notes added to yourself, like todos and reminders of all sorts. Use it any way you want, it's flexible and easy! For more information, take a look at the [feature overview](/stylo/documentation/stylo-essentials#text-attributes).  

We introduce this feature to help you organise and structure better your texts. We hope you'll find it useful! 

Please [let us know](/contact) how us how you use it!

Nodio 0.8.0 is now ready for download in the Mac App Store! 
 
New feature in this version: tags. Tags are textual attributes that can be added to any Markdown element e.g.

<pre><code>
{.tag}
This text is tagged. 
</code></pre>

They come in three forms: 

- class: 

<pre><code>
{.class}
This text has a class attribute.
</code></pre>

- id:  

<pre><code>
{#id}
This text has an id attribute.
</code></pre>

- name and value: 

<pre><code>
{name="john"}
This text has a name-value attribute.
</code></pre>

The tag panel allows to highlight selected tags in text files and to navigate through them. This makes it easy to visually recognize tagged text. They can also be filtered to allow to see only the ones you are interested in. This feature makes it easier to find the information you need in the texts in a document.

This release also contains a complete rework of the UI design. More specifically to make the light mode nicer and generally make Nodio overall look better. The title bar is now completely unified, sidebars are located below the title bar. 

Some of the bugs fixes included are:

- header are now part of text selection
- undo-redo sometimes was not properly undoing the changes 
- sometimes text was moving slightly while writing  
- full screen problem when resizing editors panes
- files outlines issues with moving items 

Nodio is still free! The releases before the 1.0.0 are mostly aimed at getting as much user feedback as possible. Tell us what you think at support@textually.net.

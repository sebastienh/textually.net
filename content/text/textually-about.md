# Who are we?

Textually is dedicated to develop innovative ways to organise and structure textual information. 

Our main products are [Stylo](/stylo) and [Nodio](/nodio). Both are the firsts expressions and the start of an 
answer to the question of what could be the best way to organize textual information. By nature 
text is not structured and most of us structure their textual information using files to group related information. This is a very simple 
and natural way of doing and both Stylo and Nodio offers to manage multiple files in a project.   

Other _intra text_ ways of organising the information are also used but they mostly address the structure of the text inside the file. 
Stylo adds _[tags](/stylo/documentation/stylo-essentials#textAttributesAndHighlight)_ that can be put inside the documents to easily identify parts of texts related to a particular subject.   

We still feel that more could be done to help writers and we are working towards some ideas of our own which will be gradually be
included in both [Stylo](/stylo) and [Nodio](/nodio).

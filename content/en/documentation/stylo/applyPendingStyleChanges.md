# Apply pending style changes (`⇧⌘C`)

Changes made when editing a style are not applied automatically to the Markdown text for performance reasons. It must therefore be explicitly requested to apply style pending changes. This is the purpose of the `Apply` button (located at the right of the _Style editor_ tools panel). It will only be enabled if there are differences between the currently applied style and the edited style.

To apply pending changes::

- From the CSS editor title panel of a style, click on the `Apply` button

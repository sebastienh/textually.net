# Add a style (`⇧⌘A`)

New styles can created from the [_Styles List_](#showHideStylesList). 

To add a style, do one of the following:

- Click on the `+` button in the title panel of the _Styles List_
- From the menu, choose: `View`→`Styles`→`Add Style`
- With the keyboard shortcut: `⇧⌘A`

Note: A new style initial value is always the same as the selected style. So, the style addition can also be used to duplicate style.

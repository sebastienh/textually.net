Stylo is a Markdown text editor which allows to define the text editor appearance in CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). It supports editing [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and save to the native _.stylo_ file format which is simply a directory presented as a single file to the user. 

Each appearance is refered to as a _style_.  The _.stylo_ file format keeps style information along with the Markdown text documents so that any change made to the styles are saved with the document. Stylo also support export in HTML, PDF, Word, Markdown and plain text formats.

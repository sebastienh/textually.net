# Style Picker sidebar tab

The _Style Picker_ sidebar tab provides quick access to all available styles for a document.

It contains, from top to bottom:

1. the _Sidebar Tab Switcher_ button to switch to the _Tools_ tab

The button shows a pen tip and a brush tip one above the other. When pressed it switches the sidebar to the _Tools_ tab.

2. a list of style previews buttons

A style preview is a smaller version of a style preview in the _Styles List_. It allows to select a style. 

3. a positioning indicator (if the window is too small to show all styles previews buttons)

The length of the indicator is proportional to the amount of styles that are visible over the total number of styles. If the positioning indicator is on the left, the styles list shows the style at the beginning of the styles. The indicator moves to the right to indicate that we are closer to the end of the list. This indicator can not be directly manipulated.

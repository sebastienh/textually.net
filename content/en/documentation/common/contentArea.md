# Content area 

The content area contains all the [Editors Panels](#editorsPanel), the sidebar button(s) and the _markdown quick formatting tools_. 

Moving the mouse in the window will automatically reveal the sidebar button(s) and the [_markdown quick formatting tools_](#markdownQuickFormattingTools) if they are hidden. Conversly, starting to write in any editor will cause them to disappear.

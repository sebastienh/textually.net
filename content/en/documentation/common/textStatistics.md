# Text Statistics and Session Popup

The _Text statistics and Session Popup_ provides usefull metrics about all the text files in the current document, like total number of characters, words, etc... The session tools are meant to complement this information by providing the change in the text statistics from a point in time. A user may start a session and later know the text statistics changes since the moment the session was started. Note that this information is saved with the document, so it can be closed and the session information wont be lost. 

The text statistics popup shows the total text statistics and the session statistics. The total text statistics are in gray, and the session statistics, along with the session related controls, are shown in the current system accent color.  The session tools are disabled by default and needs to be  enabled to be used, see [Enable/Disable Session Tools](#enableDisableSessionTools) section for more information.

# Session 

_Session Tools_ are used to record the changes in total text statistics over time. When started, a session records the staticstics changes from that moment (_Session start date_). _Session Tools_ are considered an advanced feature and are disabled by default. To enable the session tools see [Enable/Disable Session Tools](#enableDisableSessionTools). 

Once the _Session Tools_ are enabled, it is possible to start a session, which will effectively start to record the statistics changes. To start a session see [Start/Restart a session](#startRestartSession) section. When a session is started, it's possible to hide or show the session information using the `Hide` or `Show` buttons (see [Show/Hide a session](#showHideSession) section). It is also possible to restart the session counters (which effectively creates a new session), all the counters are then be reset to 0 and count from that new reference date. If text is added, the counters will increase, on the contrary, if text is removed, the counters will decrease, so, be aware, it is possible to get negative sessions values. To know when a session has been started, look at the _Session start date_ label at the bottom of the _Text statitics and session popup_.

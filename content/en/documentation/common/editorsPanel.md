# Editors Panes 

Nodio can display multiple _editors panes_ at the same time. In turn, each _editors pane_ supports displaying multiple editors. 

## Editors Pane Title Bar 

Each _Editors Pane_ has its own title bar located at the top. It allows to: 

  - close the current _editors pane_  using the left _Close Editors Pane_ button that represented by a `x`. 
  - navigate in the navigation history using the _Go Back_ and _Go Forward_ buttons each represented by an left and right arrow respectively.
  - change its name using the _Editors Pane Title_ text field name which is editable.
  - add a new [_File Editor_](#fileEditor) under the currently edited one using the _Add Editor_ button without needing to access the _Project Tool_ left sidebar's [Files Outline View](#filesOutlineView). The newly created text file will automatically be inserted in the current _Editors Pane_ associated files outline selection. It will also be located directly under the _Add Editor_ button's panel's associated file in the same directory. 
- add a new _Editors Pane_ after the current one using the right _Add Editors Pane_ button.


### Navigation History

Each _Editors Pane_ keeps a complete history of all items added and removed to it and they allow to move this history using the `Go back` and `Go Forward` buttons. Any item addition or removal resulting from direct user action will remove all history forward from the current point ni history, a bit like a web browser.

# Files Outlines Panel 

The files outlines panel is the central location to go to manipulate files and editors panes. A document is a collection of files organized using a directory structure, no proprietary format involved. 

Each [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel) has a name which may or may not be unique, no name constraints are enforced by Nodio. 

The popup menu in the middle of the _Files Outlines Panel Title Bar_ displays the currently selected [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel)'s name. It allows to change the currently selected [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel). Note, as previously mentionned, that each [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel) comes with its associated files outline view, so when changing the currently selected [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel), the selected [Files outline view](#filesOutlineView) is also changed to the one associated with the newly selected [_Editors Pane_](#editorsPanel).

The files outlines panel contains two views: 

 - [_Files Outlines Panel Title Bar_](#filesOutlinesTitleBar)
 - [_Files Outline View_](#filesOutlineView)

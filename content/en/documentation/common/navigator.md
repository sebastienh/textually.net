# Navigator

The navigator is the central location to go to manipulate files and editors panels. A document is a collection of files organized using a directory structure. 

The navigator contains navigator tools to navigate the text and in general tools that control content associated with files inside the document. It is divided in two parts: 

 - the [_navigator title bar_](#navigatorTitleBar) 
 - the _navigator content area_ 

The _navigator title bar_ allows to change the [Editors Panel](#editorsPanel) and/or the current navigator tool. The tool displayed in the _navigator content area_ is the result of the conjunction of them.

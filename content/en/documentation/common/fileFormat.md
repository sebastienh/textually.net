# File format 

To be as opened as possible and let you use your files as you want, the file format is based on a simple directory structure. The document itself is a directory displayed as a single file called a  _package_. To see the content of a document, right click on it and chose `Show Package Contents`. You should then see all your files as you see them in the files outline panel. 

Following the standard directory structure impose some logical and easily overcome limits. For example, under a directory two files cannot have the same name. When a name is given to file and that file name is already used inside the directory, an error will popup and the name will be reversed to its original value. Simply choosing a unique name will allow to change the file's name.

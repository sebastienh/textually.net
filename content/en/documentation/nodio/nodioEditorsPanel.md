# Editor 
 
The _Editors_ panel displays all the selected files from the corresponding [files outline](#filesOutline). At the top of the _Editors_ panel, the _document title bar_ displays the name of the document along with _back_ and _forward_ buttons to move back and forward into the history. Each editor displays a title bar, the text and a panel with a plus button.  

## Title bar  
 
The title bar displays an editable file name, a _Record_ button and a _Show/Hide Editor_ button. 

The title bar can be used to moved the window, the same as a classical title. On double click, the filename becomes editable to allow to modify it from inside the editor. 


### _Show/Hide Editor_ button

As we already mentioned, the _Editors_ panel displays the selected files from the associated [files outline](#filesOutline). If for some reason, we need to temporarily hide an editor that we don't need but still want to keep in the selection. In this case, we can use the _Show/Hide_ button to do so. When hidden, only the title bar from will be shown and both the text editor and the plus panel will be hidden. 

### _Add Editor_ button 

Below each text editor, there is a _Add Editor_ button panel which allows to add a new text file without needing to access the _Project Tool_ left sidebar's [files outline](#filesOutline). The newly created text file will automatically be inserted in the current _Editors_ panel associated files outline selection. It will also be located directly under the _Add Editor_ button's panel's associated file in the same directory.

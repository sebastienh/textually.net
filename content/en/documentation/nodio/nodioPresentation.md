# Nodio: Audio and Markdown 


Nodio is a text editor aiming to simplify the management of multiple text documents in contexts where they are based on or associated with recorded audio. Each file in Nodio may have any number of recorded audio files associated with it. Complete control of the audio recording is given through the keyboard allowing live control of audio recording and playback with just some keystrokes. 

## Audio 

Nodio uses a novel and unique approach to make it possible to record multiple audio files per text document. This way each part of a speech can be individually recorded and referred back to when needed. Second, each audio file can be given a unique name further making it easy to refer to it later.  

With this flexibility in managing audio files, it becomes perfectly possible to take notes on something that has been said previously while recording what is being at the moment without loosing anything. It makes it also possible to prepare the notes in advance and to record the associated audio later. There is no implied association between the process of recording and writing, it needs to be specified by the user. 

On top of this extremely simple and intuitive handling of audio, it is possible to completely manage the audio without leaving the keyboard, making it really easy to take notes at full speed without being interrupted by audio management tasks.  


## Markdown

Nodio also supports Markdown in its CommonMark incarnation. We think Markdown adds some interesting features such as the conversion from one source format to multiple outputs formats. Which allows to export Nodio file(s) to any of the supported formats: HTML, PDF, Word, plain text, Markdown. This guide includes an overview of [Markdown](../markdown#mdContents).    

All the features of Nodio are there in definitive to make life easier. We are, of course, always open for comments and suggestions. May you have anything to share please do not hesitate to reach us at support@textually.net. 


We hope you will enjoy Nodio!

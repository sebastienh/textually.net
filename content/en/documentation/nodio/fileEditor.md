Each _Editors Pane_ displays all the selected files from the corresponding [files outline](#filesOutlineView) in its own editor. Each editor displays a title bar and the text content in an editor.

The middle directories between the top and the file are represented with their first letter only and will expand when the mouse is over them. When there is not enough space even for the top group and the last,  the file name, they will be gradually compressed also. 

It's always possible to change the file's name using the _file path_ by clicking on it to go in edition mode. 


### Audio controls 

The _audio controls_ show a _Record_ button and a _Show/Hide Editor_ button. 

The title bar can be used to moved the window, the same as a classical title. On double click, the filename becomes editable to allow to modify it from inside the editor.

When hidden, only the title bar from will be shown and both the text editor and the plus panel will be hi

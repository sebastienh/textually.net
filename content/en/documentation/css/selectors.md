# Selectors

A selector makes it possible to specify how to select the elements for which the style definition, which follows, applies to. When an element is selected by a selector, we say that the element _matches_ the selector. 

There are several different selectors:

- [type selector](#typeSelector)
- [id selector](#idSelector)
- [class selector](#classSelector)
- [Universal selector](#universalSelector)
- [attribute selector](#attributeSelector)
- [pseudo-element selector](#pseudoElementSelector) 
- [pseudo-class selector](#pseudoClassSelector)

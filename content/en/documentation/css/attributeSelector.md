# Attribute selector 

The attribute selector allows to select elements based on the presence/absence or value of any attribute. It takes the general form of the name of the attribute optionally followed by a [_text selection expression_](#attributeMatch) and the partial or complete value of the attribute, all placed between a left square braquet '[' and a right square braquet ']'.

- [Attributes existence](#attributeExistence)
- [Attribute value](#attributeValue)

Note: Since attributes are not used in Stylo, it is safe to skip all the section related to attributes based selectors.

# Emphasis  

There are two types of emphasis that correspond to the two HTML elements _strong_ and _em_. The `strong` element delimits important text and is usually styled with bold text. The `em` element delimits emphased text and is usually styled with italicized text.

## Syntax

To emphasize a section of text, simply enclose it with an "*" (star) or an "_" (underscore):

Markdown:

``` markdown
*Emphasized text 1*
_Emphasized text 2_
```

HTML:

``` html 
<em>Emphasized text 1</em>
<em>Emphasized text 2</em>
```

To define an important section of text, simply enclose it with two "*" (star) or two "_" (underscore):

Markdown: 

``` markdown 
**important text**  
__important text__
```

HTML:

``` html
<strong>important text</strong>
<strong>important text</strong>
```            

## Pseudo-elements  

The pseudo-elements offered by these two elements are:

- `tag`: covers the stars or underscores used to define the emphasis or important text on both sides of the text.

# Start/Stop a recording (`⌃⌘R`, `⌃⌘S`  )

A recording can be started multiple ways. One of the objective of Nodio is to be able to control most of the audio recording functionalities while writing, so in addition to being able to add a new audio recording from the audio panel, it is possible to start an audio recording from a text document title bar inside the editor panel and using the keyboard with the `⌃⌘R` keys combination.
   

## Start/Add a new recording (`⌃⌘R`)

To start a new audio recording: 

- From a text document title bar, click on the red _Record_ button. Note that it might contain a plus sign if there is already an ongoing recording for this particular text document. The end result though, is the same: a new recording is started for the corresponding text document.  

- From the audio panel: identify the text document title view in the audio panel, and click on the red _Record_ button. As already mentioned, there might be a plus sign inside the record but it doesn't change the final result which is to start a new recording for the selected text document. 

- Using the keyboard shortcut: press `⌃⌘R`. This will start a new audio recording in the currently edited document. 


## Stop recording (`⌃⌘S` )

To stop the current ongoing recording: 

- From the actively recording text document title bar, click on the red _Stop Recording_ button on the right of the _Record_ button. 

- From the right sidebar. When there is a recording the right sidebar should show the _Stop Recording_ button is active mode. Clicking on it will stop the current recording, no matter where it has been started. 

- From the audio panel: go to the audio panel title view and click on the active _Stop Recording_ button. 

- Using the keyboard shortcut: press `⌃⌘S`

**Important Note**: that an audio recording is automatically stopped if the associated text document is not shown in the audio panel.

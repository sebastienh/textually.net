# Start/Pause playing (`⌃⌘S` )

Playing a recording can be done two ways: from the text document editor panel title bar or from the audio panel. To be able to play a recording from a text document editor panel title bar, the particular recording needs to be selected in the audio panel first, otherwise the audio recoding controls are not visible in the text document editor panel title bar. Note that a recoding is automatically selected when it starts. 

## Start playing a recording 

To play an audio recording:

- From the text document editor panel title bar, press the _Play_ button right after the _Record_ button. Note: as previously mentioned, if there is no play button, it means no audio recording has been selected for this particular text document; go to the audio panel to select one. 

- From the audio panel, select the audio recording to play. When selected the audio playback view should appear. Click on the _Play_ button to play the audio recording. 

- From the keyboard: press `⌃⌘S` 

## Pause playing 

To pause the current ongoing playing audio recording: 

- From the actively playing text document title bar, click on the red _Pause_ button on the right of the _Record_ button. 

- From the audio panel, go to the playing audio recording. The playback view should be visible with a _Pause_ button in the bottom center. Clicking on it will pause the current playing file. 

- From the keyboard: press `⌃⌘S` 

**Important Note**: that a playing audio recording is automatically paused if the associated text document is not shown in the audio panel.

# Document

An HTML document uses the HTML markup language and is defined by a set of elements. Each element is defined by an opening tag in the form _<element_name>_ and closing tag that have the general form _</element_name>_.  An HTML document must begin with the document type tag: `doctype` with the `html` value, and must be followed by the opening tag `<html>` and end with the closing tag `</html>`, these two tags create an  _html_ element.
 
Here is an example of an HTML document:

HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

The elements of an HTML document form a tree structure. In the HTML above, the `html` is the parent of the `body` element. See the [Definitions](#definitions) section for more information.

# `id`

An `id` is a unique identifier, in the context of a document, given to an element. To give an `id` to an element, it suffices to define the `id` attribute with a value on this element. For example, in the following document, the `h1` element has the id `my-first-title`:

HTML:

``` html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1 id="my-first-title">Title 1</h1>
        <h2>Title 2</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

## HTML Syntax

The id is just a special case of the [attribute syntax](#attribute-syntax) with the attribute's name set to `id`.

# text-decoration-style

This property is used in conjunction with `text-decoration-line` property  and allows to assign a style to the text decoration lines.

Formal definition: <code>text-decoration-style: solid | double | dotted | dashed | wavy | [initial](/stylo/documentation/css#css-property-values-initial) 
| [inherit](/stylo/documentation/css#css-property-values-inherit);</code>

The default value is `solid` which gives a "full" style to the line; the `double` style doubles the line; the `dotted` style gives a dotted line; the `dashed` style gives a dashed line; finally, the `wavy` style gives a wave shape to the line.

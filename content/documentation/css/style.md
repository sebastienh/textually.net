# Style 

A style is a set of properties with values. A style is always associated with a selector that allows to specify how to select the elements to which the style will apply. For example, in: 

CSS:

```
body {
    color: red;
}
```

`body` is the selector. It specifies how to select the elements to which the properties defined in the style can be applied to. This style can be applied  to elements of type `body`. The style defines a single property: `color`, and sets its value to `red`. The selector and the style are together referred as _style declaration_ in CSS. 

Note: In Stylo, only a few properties are supported. For a complete list of supported properties and their use, see the [Properties](/stylo/documentation/css#properties) section.

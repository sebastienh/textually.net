# Selectors

A selector makes it possible to specify how to select the elements for which the style definition, which follows, applies to. When an element is selected by a selector, we say that the element _matches_ the selector. 

There are several different selectors:

- [type selector](/stylo/documentation/css#type-selector)
- [id selector](/stylo/documentation/css#id-selector)
- [class selector](/stylo/documentation/css#class-selector)
- [Universal selector](/stylo/documentation/css#universal-selector)
- [attribute selector](/stylo/documentation/css#attribute-selector)
- [pseudo-element selector](/stylo/documentation/css#pseudo-element-selector) 
- [pseudo-class selector](/stylo/documentation/css#pseudo-class-selector)

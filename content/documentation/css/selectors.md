# Selectors

A selector makes it possible to specify how to select the elements for which the style definition, which follows, applies to. When an element is selected by a selector, we say that the element _matches_ the selector. 

There are several different selectors:

- [type selector](#type-selector)
- [id selector](#id-selector)
- [class selector](#class-selector)
- [Universal selector](#universal-selector)
- [attribute selector](#attribute-selector)
- [pseudo-element selector](#pseudo-element-selector) 
- [pseudo-class selector](#pseudo-class-selector)

# Attribute value 

The attribute value selector selects elements based on the value of an attribute. To use it, we need to place the name of the attribute in square brackets, followed by the _text selection expression_, followed by the match text.  

There are six differents _text selection expressions_:

- [Exact match](/stylo/documentation/css#exact-match)
- [Contains word match](/stylo/documentation/css#contains-word-match)
- [Starts with word match](/stylo/documentation/css#starts-with-word-match)
- [First word begins with substring](/stylo/documentation/css#first-word-match)
- [Last word ends with substring](/stylo/documentation/css#last-word-match)
- [A word contains substring](/stylo/documentation/css#word-contains-match)

# Stylesheet

A stylesheet is a set of styles declarations. It can be of three different origins:

1. User Agent: This will be the browser in most cases, but in Stylo case, it is Stylo itself.
2. Author: stylesheets edited by the author of web site.
3. User: The style sheet that a user, usually a browser user, can edit.

Of these three stylesheets types, only the second, _Author_, is editable in Stylo. The _User_ stylesheet does not exist in Stylo since access is given to all the power of CSS directly through the _Author_ stylesheet.

# User Interface

Stylo is a [distration free](#distraction-free) text editor. It is designed to leave maximum space to the text and to get out of the way when writing. 

The interface is divided into three main sections, the _Text_, the _Styles_ and the [_Sidebar_](#sidebar) sections. The _Text_ section can be in [Mardown](#markdown-editor) or [Preview](#html-preview) mode. The  _Styles_ section contains the [_Styles List_](#styles-list) and the [_Style Editor_](#style-editor). The [_Sidebar_](#sidebar)  contains the [_Tools_](#tools) and the [_Style Picker_](#style-picker) tabs.

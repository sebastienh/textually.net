# Save as...

To save a Stylo document in Markdown or plain text format:

- While pressing the option (`⌥`) key, from the menu choose `File`→`Save as...`
- In the `Save as` panel chose the desired file format (`Stylo`, `Plain Text` or `Markdown`) and save the file at the desired location.

Note: When the edited document is in either plain text or Markdown format, to be able to edit the styles, it first needs to be saved in Stylo format.

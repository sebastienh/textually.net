## Essentials

Stylo is a Markdown text editor which allows to define the text appearance in CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). It supports editing [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and plain text files in addition to the native _.stylo_ file format which is simply a directory presented as a single file to the user. 

Each appearance is refered as a _style_.  The _.stylo_ file format keeps style information along with the text document so that any change made to the styles are saved with the document. It is always possible to save a _.stylo_ file to Mardkown or plain text. Stylo also offers many export formats (HTML, PDF, Word).

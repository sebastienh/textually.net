# Open a document

Stylo can be used to edit and save any plain text or Mardkown file in addition to the native Stylo format. As Stylo only supports styles editing for native _.stylo_ files, to modify the styles of plain text and Markdown documents, they first need to be saved as a _.stylo_ document, see [Save as...](#save-as) section. For plain text and Markdown documents, the styles are in _read-only_ mode and can be accessed through the _Style Picker_ sidebar tab. 

To open a document:

- From the menu, choose `File`→`Open`    
- With the keyboard shortcut: `⌘O`

Once the open panel is visible, chose the file to open.
